                <h2>WordPress History</h2>
                <p>Wordpress was started because the blogging software b2/cafelog was discontinued. In 2003 Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little built off that software to create WordPress. At first it was just for blogging. Now WordPress powers around 45% of all websites on the web today. In 2004 it changed significantly by adding plugins and themes. By 2011 WordPress was the most popular CMS on the internet.</p>
