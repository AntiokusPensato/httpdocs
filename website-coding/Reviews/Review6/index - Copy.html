            <h2>Review of LogRocket and BrowserStack </h2>
            <p><strong>Website Names:</strong><a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/css-breakpoints-responsive-design/">LogRocket</a> and <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/responsive-design-breakpoints">BrowserStack</a></a></p>
            <p><strong>Website Purpose:</strong> This page specifically is about CSS Breakpoints and responsive design.</p>
            <p><strong>Findings:</strong> It seems there are several common breakpoints for min width.
                <ul>
                    <li>Small devices - 576px and up</li>
                    <li>Medium devices - 768px and up</li>
                    <li>Large devices - 992px and up</li>
                    <li>Extra large devices - 1200px and up</li>
                </ul></p>
            <p> From what I read typically you can choose a breakpoint via device based, content based, or a combined approach. Between these three it's probably best to use a combined approach. This allows you to design content to be fluid or adapt to container size. As LogRocket says look to minimize intervention. You want the content to do the work for you.</p>
            <p> All and all it seems you want to develop for a mobile audience first and work your way through breakpoints to adjust for increasing device screen size. There are several ways to test how responsive your website is. The Browser Stack website has a testing feature that allows you to see your page on different devices. The developer tools in your browser can also show different screen sizes and how it looks on them.</p>
