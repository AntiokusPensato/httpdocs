            <h2>Review of Ionos</h2>
            <p><strong>Website Names:</strong> <a href="https://www.ionos.com/?__lf=Order-Tariff">Ionos</a></p>
            <p><strong>Website Purpose:</strong> A website hosting service.</p>
            <p><strong>Questions:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Does the website's home page validate? -</strong> It validates but there are quite a few warnings and errors on this page. A few hundred it looks like.</li>
                    <li><strong>If you were to have your own website, what would the domain name be? -</strong> I have not thought on this very much. If I were to proceed with Web Development I believe I would need a portfolio site. So for that maybe just my name trevordavis.com </li>
                    <li><strong>Using the hosting website, document which of your top 3 preferred domains are available -</strong> Turns out trevordavis.com is not available. trevordavis.org is so that would probably be my second choice and then trevordavis.info maybe as a second choice. Which is also available.</li>
                    <li><strong>How would you rate the site's design, on a scale of 1(horrible) to 10 (fantastic)? Why? -</strong> I will give it an 8, I like the color gradients and how everything is broken apart. Picking a con I think there's a lot going on right away. Most of it I just skimmed.</li>
                    <li><strong>How would you rate the site's usability on a scale of 1 (horrible) to 10 (fantastic)? Why? -</strong> I'll go with a 8 here as well. It is pretty easy to find what you're looking for. Searching for a domain package is a few clicks in. Any other info you would be looking for would be similar in accessibility.</li>
