    <h2>Website Information</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Website Name:</strong>W3Schools<br>
        <strong>Website Purpose:</strong> Learning to Code
    </p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <h3>1. Does the site's home page validate?</h3>
    <p>Yes it does.</p>

    <h3>2. Find any other page on the site. Does the second page validate?</h3>
    <p>I clicked on the link for C, this page validates as well.</p>

    <h3>3. Document how many validation errors and/or warning may exist on each of the two pages you validate.</h3>
    <p>The home page had 5 warnings and 31 errors. Second page C had 5 warnings and 18 errors. </p>

    <h3>4. How would you rate the site's design, on a scale of 1(horrible) to 10(fantastic)? Why?</h3>
    <p> I would give the site a 5. I don't know a ton about site design but I know personally I do not like when sites have a bunch of adds all over on each page. Beyond that it is pretty basic and not really all that visually appealing. </p>

    <h3>5. How would you rate the site's usability on a scale of 1(horrible) to 10(fantastic)? Why?</h3>
    <p>For this I rate it 7. As far as navigating the site it is straight forward and easy. If you want to do something on HTML you click the link and then there are quite a few other links relating to different aspects of HTML itself. Same goes for each of the other coding languages.</p>

    <h3>6. Does the site meet its purpose?</h3>
    <p>I would think so, its there to teach you coding and it looks like there are lots of resources to meet that end.</p>
