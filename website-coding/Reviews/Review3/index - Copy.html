      <li><strong>What are Progressive Enhancements? -</strong> The definition given on this website is that it is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core web page content first. This strategy then progressively adds more nuanced and technically rigorous layers of presentation and features on top of the content as the end-user's browser/Internet connection allow. &mdash; Wikipedia</li>

      <li><strong>How would you rate the site's design, on a scale of 1 (horrible) to 10 (fantastic)? Why? -</strong> I give it a 7, it is laid out well, simple colors, some images. I don't like the adds, although I know it's for a reason and that there are add blockers out there if you really don't want to see them.</li>
      <li><strong>How would you rate the site's usability on a scale of 1 (horrible) to 10 (fantastic)? Why? -</strong> Usability id give a 8, it is fairly simple to use. There's no menu though, at least that I saw. All tutorials are found via search.</li>
      <li><strong>Does the site meet its purpose? -</strong> I think it does. If you're trying to find tuturials on coding there's 10000+ or so it says on this site.</li>
