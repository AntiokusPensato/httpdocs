    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <h3>1. What is the site's URL? Why is it your favorite?</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://www.csszengarden.com">https://www.csszengarden.com</a> I liked the simplicity of the website. You could click links to the different designs
        Also as the website explains they use functional and practical CSS, not the newest tricks only viewable by 2% of the viewing public. Beyond that the Examples
        given are pretty neat.

    <h3>2. Does the site's home page validate?</h3>
    <p>Yes, there are a few warnings for unnecessary elements.</p>

    <h3>3. Find any other page on the site. Does the second page validate?</h3>
    <p>I went to the apothecary CSS page, this page validates with a few warnings.</p>

    <h3>4. Document how many validation errors and/or warning may exist on each of the two pages you validate.</h3>
    <p>The home page had 4 warnings. Second page Apothecary had 4 warnings. </p>

    <h3>5. How would you rate the site's design, on a scale of 1(horrible) to 10(fantastic)? Why?</h3>
    <p> I give this site a 9. This site has some cool CSS pages displayed in multiple different designs. Although some of them are not to my preference it still shows what variety you can achieve using CSS. Some have animations as well.   </p>

    <h3>6. How would you rate the site's usability on a scale of 1(horrible) to 10(fantastic)? Why?</h3>
    <p>I'll give it a 10 Simple layout, the content is the same throughout. It only changes the design using each link, so it is easy to understand. It also provides example files of the html and CSS which is pretty cool for reference. </p>

    <h3>7. Does the site meet its purpose?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it shows examples of CSS and even gives examples of the code used.</p>
