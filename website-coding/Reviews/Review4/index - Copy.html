        <p> According to both websites User Testing is basically observing real people test the functionality of a website, app, or other digital product.</p><br>
          There are several types of usability tests:
          <ol>
            <li>Moderated Usability Testing</li>
            <li>Unmoderated Usability Testing</li>
            <li>In-person Usability Testing</li>
            <li>Remote Usability Testing</li>
          </ol>
            <p>The definitions of these are pretty straight forward. With moderated and unmoderated your either supervised or not. With In-person and remote you're either on site with the tester or not.</P>
            <p>User testing is important to understad how your site works, if there are any bugs or errors, to confirm your website meets client expectations, and getting feedback for potential changes</p>
            <p>Another way User Testing is done is through surveys. These are good if you need a large range of responses in little time. Since you can choose when and where you do these tests it makes it flexible for your needs and for others.</p>
            <p>From my understanding to test a website on different versions of browsers the tester would need to install multiple browsers and even operating systems on different devices such as a desktop, laptop, or mobile device. Then run your website on all of these. Obviously this would help determine things such as your website functioning properly across multiple devices. Maybe if people prefer a specific browser or device.</p>
