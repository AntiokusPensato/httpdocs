                <p><a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a> -- CodePen is a pretty neat site. I've stumbled across it before this assignment. You can easily put in whatever you're searching for and find some relevant code. The neat thing about it though is that it has a real time output area. You can even edit the shown code and see how it changes the element.  </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>There are tons of sites out there with information on Hamburger Menu's, these three gave me a good start. I really like CodePen and it's ability to show real time changes without having to put it in your VScode.</p>
